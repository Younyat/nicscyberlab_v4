    'cancel_requested' — see below) but nothing has touched it (no
    update_job/append_phase call, which now always stamps 'updated_at') for
    _ORPHAN_JOB_GRACE_SECONDS, and no thread in THIS worker process is
    actively running it, treat it as interrupted rather than leaving it
    stuck forever.

    Mirrors foc_reconstruction.foc_case_analysis._recover_orphaned_analysis_status
    (which already catches this for nested analysis phases) at the outer job
    level, so a dead job doesn't block new launches (see
    level_b_repetition_runner.find_active_level_b_job) or sit invisible in the
    Live Campaign Status panel forever. Does not delete or retry anything —
    only marks the truth and lets the operator decide what's next.

    'cancel_requested' is included as of 2026-07-19: a job whose thread died
    (e.g. a gunicorn worker cycled during a reload) AFTER a cancel/force-stop
    request was recorded but BEFORE the thread itself ever reached a
    job_cancel_requested() checkpoint to actually process it and set a real
    terminal status stays in 'cancel_requested' forever otherwise --
    'cancel_requested' was never in _ACTIVE_JOB_TERMINAL_STATUSES, so a job
    stuck there doesn't just look wrong, it permanently blocks
    find_active_level_b_job()'s concurrent-launch guard, silently refusing
    every future launch attempt. Confirmed live: exactly this happened
    immediately after a gunicorn reload cycled the worker running a job that
    had just been asked to cancel.

    'queued' is also included, defensively, as of the same date: new_job()
    writes status='queued' and start_job() registers _THREADS[job_id] and
    calls thread.start() immediately afterwards in the same synchronous call
    stack (no I/O in between) -- so in the overwhelming majority of cases a
    'queued' job either becomes 'running' within microseconds or was never
    persisted at all. The only way one survives on disk while stuck at
    'queued' is if the worker process was killed in that exact microscopic
    window between the two calls (e.g. OOM-kill, forced worker recycle). That
    window is far narrower than for 'running'/'cancel_requested', but the
    failure mode is identical (silently blocks future launch guards forever)
    and the fix is a one-line, zero-behavior-change addition to the same
    tuple, so it is closed the same way rather than left as a residual gap.
