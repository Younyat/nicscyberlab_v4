## Executive scientific summary

This report audits a Level A repetition campaign over the same preserved case. It launched the same `Run Dry-Run Execution` scientific backend path **2** times against the same preserved evidence set in read-only mode, then consolidated those outputs into one auditable report. The preserved case shows **15 / 15** analysis layers with useful output, a causal recovery of **7 / 8** expected relations, and a repeatability comparison status of **Comparable With Degradation**.

The scientific position is therefore limited but defensible: the Level A repetition shows stable analytical behavior over the preserved case, while causal completeness remains partial where alert-to-intervention, intervention-to-preservation, timestamp ordering, or packet-level Modbus specificity are not fully supported.

## Level A repetition scope

- Same preserved case: yes
- Same preserved evidence set: yes
- Same dry-run scientific path launched several times: `2` repetition(s)
- New attack launched: no
- New scenario execution: no
- New heavy preservation: no
- Scientific purpose: verify analytical repeatability over preserved evidence, not universal reproducibility.

### Generated Level A dry-run executions

- Repetition 1: `EXEC-0001`
- Repetition 2: `EXEC-0002`

This workflow is equivalent to pressing `Run Dry-Run Execution` several times from the Level A campaign and then generating one consolidated scientific report from those fresh repetitions.

### Narrative storyline

- story step: Modbus register and value precision (declared in ground truth as register=4, expected_value=30) is not confirmed by packet-level parsing; only the presence of Modbus traffic is verified here.
- story step: Protocol presence confirmed at packet level, but no write-function code (5/6/15/16) packet was found in this pcap.
- story step: IDS signature name asserts a write; not confirmed at packet level (see network layer counter-evidence).
- story step: OT export record counts confirm export activity but contain no setpoint or process-value content.
- story step: Case-wide manifest validation is partial (0.9757); some artifacts remain hash-unvalidated.
- story step: IDS signature name asserts a write; not confirmed at packet level (see network layer counter-evidence).
- story step: Modbus register and value precision (declared in ground truth as register=4, expected_value=30) is not confirmed by packet-level parsing; only the presence of Modbus traffic is verified here.

## Evidence-to-claim audit table

| Claim ID | Status | Confidence | Claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-SCOPE-READONLY` | `supported` | `strong` | This report is a Level A reanalysis of the same preserved case and does not represent a new attack, new scenario execution, or new heavy preservation event. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-MULTILAYER-COMPLETED` | `supported` | `strong` | The preserved case has complete multilayer analytical coverage with useful outputs across the expected layers. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-NETWORK-MODBUS` | `partial` | `moderate` | Network evidence confirms Modbus/TCP activity, but the current extraction layer does not fully prove packet-level register and value precision. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-MEMORY-COMPLETED` | `supported` | `strong` | Memory analysis completed successfully and produced reusable Volatility-based outputs for all preserved dumps included in this case. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-TRIGGER-LIMITATION` | `partial` | `moderate` | The operational acquisition trigger is not a complete causal proof of the OT incident path and must be interpreted separately from OT causal evidence. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-ALERT-INTERVENTION-PRESERVATION-CHAIN` | `partial` | `limited` | The alert-to-intervention-to-preservation chain is not fully proven by the preserved artifacts in this case. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-CAUSAL-PARTIAL` | `partial` | `moderate` | The causal reconstruction is partial rather than complete: some expected causal relations were recovered, some remain degraded, and some remain missing. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-HYPOTHESIS-MODERATE` | `partial` | `moderate` | The reconstructed incident hypothesis currently receives moderate support, not absolute causality. |
| `CLAIM-LEVELA-CPR-STABLE` | `supported` | `strong` | This Level A repetition can be compared with previous Level A executions using CPR and Weighted CPR drift metrics derived from the generated comparison profiles. |

## Limitations and degraded states

- Semantic reconstruction has not been generated.
- At least one causal edge is temporally ambiguous under the preserved uncertainty window.
- Some causal edges could not be temporally ordered because the required artifact timestamps were not available or not resolvable.
- Modbus traffic is observed, but register and value precision are not confirmed by packet-level parsing.
- Modbus register and value precision (declared in ground truth as register=4, expected_value=30) is not confirmed by packet-level parsing; only the presence of Modbus traffic is verified here.
- 1 causal edges remain temporally ambiguous under the current uncertainty window.
- Case-wide integrity remains partial.

## Scientific conclusion

The preserved evidence supports a partial causal-forensic reconstruction of a controlled OT incident. The evidence processing coverage is strong because the multilayer analysis completed and produced useful outputs across 15 layers. The causal reconstruction recovered 7 of 8 expected causal relations and degraded 0 relations due to partial or inferred evidence. The hypothesis receives moderate support, not strong support. Causal temporal ordering confidence is limited, case-wide integrity status is partial, and the stated Modbus/trigger limitations remain. The normalized Evidence Support Extract assesses the controlling hypothesis as moderate support.

The correct scientific interpretation for this Level A run is therefore:

The preserved case provides strong evidence preservation and complete multilayer analytical coverage. The Level A repetition shows stable analytical repeatability over the same preserved case. However, the causal reconstruction remains partial where alert-to-intervention, intervention-to-preservation, or Modbus register/value confirmation are not fully supported by the available evidence.
