- Warnings: `Causal reconstruction is blocked because multilayer forensic analysis has not been generated for this case. | Semantic reconstruction has not been generated. | Causal reconstruction is blocked because multilayer forensic analysis has not been generated for this case. | Integrity and custody validation supports evidentiary trust in the preserved artifacts; it does not by itself confirm the causal hypothesis. | Heavy generated case artifacts were cleaned after nested Level A reporting so the next Level B repetition could create a fresh case without accumulating heavy storage.`
