- Warnings: `7 of 8 expected causal edges were recovered. The reconstruction is mostly supported by preserved evidence, but it still does not establish absolute causality. | Semantic reconstruction has not been generated. | At least one causal edge is temporally ambiguous under the preserved uncertainty window. | Some causal edges could not be temporally ordered because the required artifact timestamps were not available or not resolvable. | Modbus traffic is observed, but register and value precision are not confirmed by packet-level parsing. | Modbus register and value precision (declared in ground truth as register=4, expected_value=30) is not confirmed by packet-level parsing; only the presence of Modbus traffic is verified here. | Heavy generated case artifacts were cleaned after nested Level A reporting so the next Level B repetition could create a fresh case without accumulating heavy storage.`
