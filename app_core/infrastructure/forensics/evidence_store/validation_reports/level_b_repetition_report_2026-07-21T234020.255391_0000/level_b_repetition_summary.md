- Warnings: `5 of 8 expected causal edges were recovered. The reconstruction is partially supported and should be presented with explicit caveats on the degraded or ambiguous edges. | Integrity or custody validation remains partial. | At least one causal edge is temporally ambiguous under the preserved uncertainty window. | Some causal edges could not be temporally ordered because the required artifact timestamps were not available or not resolvable. | Modbus traffic is observed, but register and value precision are not confirmed by packet-level parsing. | Case-wide integrity or custody validation remains partial. | Integrity and custody validation remains partial for this case. | Heavy generated case artifacts were cleaned after nested Level A reporting so the next Level B repetition could create a fresh case without accumulating heavy storage.`
